### [about sams](https://cgecloudclassroom.org/classroom-resources/about-sams/)

Learning about the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is a good way to begin your study of CGE models.   The SAM is a logical format for organizing and displaying the database of a CGE model.  This organization allows you to clearly see all of the transactions that occur in an economy during a period of time (usually over a year) and how these transactions link buyers and sellers in a circular flow of income and expenditure.   In addition, a SAM’s structure is identical to that of the CGE model in which it is used. (Therefore, there is some amount of variations among SAMs.)  When you are learning about the structure and economic behavior in your CGE model,  you are likely to find yourself continually re-examining the relevant parts of your SAM.

In Chapter 3 (Burfisher, 2011), you will learn how a SAM is organized and the nature of each type of account in the SAM.  You will study the micro data that it contains and learn how they can be aggregated to describe macroeconomic data about an economy.  Finally, you learn how to manipulate the data in the SAM to develop a structure table, which provides useful descriptive indicators about the economy.

After reading Chapter 3 of the textbook, review the U.S. 3×3 SAM  and structure table.   

Open the Excel file, explore the SAM, and tab through each page for a visual guide to how each element of a structure table is constructed.   Why are structure tables useful?  You will find yourself returning to your structure table when you are ready to interpret your model results.  The structure table summarizes the SAM database, letting you know, for example, which sectors are large or small, which are labor- or capital-intensive, and which are important in trade or consumer demand.  This knowledge gives you practical insights that help you to explain the changes in quantities and prices that you will observe in model experiments.
