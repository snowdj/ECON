重要的事情说三遍。

**Practice exam, Practice exam, Practice exam**

**刷题，刷题，刷题**

1. not IQ
2. not work hard
3. do Practice exam

计划
1. 首先，把近些年 last final 做好。
2. 然后，复习近些年的midterm。
3. 最后，根据做错的题目，阅读slides。



---------------------

# midterm 1

## Types of games

- prisoner's dilemma,
- a battle of the sexes,
- a pure coordination game
- a zero sum game


## Static Game
 - weakly dominated
 - strictly dominated,
 - Solve the game by iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies,
 - Equilibrium not payoff, is strategies.

## Credible threat

In a sequential game, it can be useful for a player to have the ability to credibly commit to an action
that would result in a disastrous outcome for all players

## mixed strategy

In a mixed strategy equilibrium all pure strategies that are played with a strictly positive probability provide the same expected payoff against the other players' strategies.

## Externality and property rights

 - the payoffs under an assignment of property rights
 - describe the range of Coasean contracts that could be
written between the two farmers
 - ensure the socially desirable outcome.

## Cournot games

 - each payoff function.
 - Best response function
 - the Nash Equilibrium quantities
 - quantity should produce


-----------

# Midterm 2




## Sequential Game
 -  the path of play
 - the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium
 - Payoff function / preference
 - Best response function

## Voting

 - vote honestly (they vote for the alternative that they rank the highest among the choices available),

 - votes strategically (aiming to get a court decision that is the highest in terms of their personal ranking),

 - maximize payoff, not only vote my first candidate, but also second candidate, not my least favorite candidate

## Dynamic Games of Complete Information

## Dynamic Games of Complete and Imperfect Information
Dynamic games of complete information  Extensive-form representation

-  Game tree

-  Subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium



-  Backward induction

  - Starting wi with those smallest subgames
  -  Then move backward until the root is reached


- simultaneous Cournot Game
  - separately found the best response functions of
the two players and simultaneously solved them for q1 and q2

-  Stackelberg
  - In dynamic games with finite strategy spaces, we worked by backward induction to find the best responses of the players who move later in the game, and took that into account in determining what the best move of the player playing before that is.

-  Dynamic games of complete and imperfect information

 -  A dynamic game in which every information set contains exactly one node is called a game of perfect information.
 -  A dynamic game in which some information sets contain more than one node is called a game of imperfect information.

## Bargaining

 - The Game Tree

 - Backward Induction (SPNE)

  - The Naïve Sequential Bargaining Game
    -  Striking result – all gains to last person to make an offer (add one round of offer to see what happens!)
    - All of the bargaining power due to the time constraint
    -
  - Sequential Bargaining with Discounting
    - δ is called the discount rate and β=1/(1+δ) is called the discount factor. Note that 0<β<1 but that as one becomes very impatient (as δ goes to infinity) the limit of β goes to zero, meaning that the player does not care at all about future consumption.
    -  In round 100, Sally would offer to perform the service for \$300 and Bill would accept.
    -  Now consider the subgame that begins with Bill making an offer in round 99. Bill knows that Sally is impatient and is indifferent between the \$100 in surplus she that surplus she would get in period 100 and \$100*β=\$97 now (in period 99). Thus, Bill can offer as little as P99=\$297 and sally would accept such an offer.
  -  In this set up, having a lousy outside opportunity (low discount rate) means that one is less affected by the loss of time implied by a rejection and moving to the next round. It implies MORE bargaining power!
