## Environmental Economics




##### Consider a single emitter of a pollutant. Assume that the government knows the MAC curve but not the MD curve.


an optimal emissions tax, the optimal number of transferable emission permits and an optimal performance standard would all yield the same level of social welfare.


??? Only under uncertainty,  whether an emission tax or transferable emission permits results in social welfare loss depends on the steepness of the MAC curve.

##### Creating the incentive for firms to innovate to reduce their MAC curves

depends on the choice of government policy.

##### If transferable emission permits are auctioned off

The outcome is the same as if the property right was granted to the recipient and there was a negotiated outcome
