## Environmental Economics





## Normative analysis



##  Pollution damages
### Marginal damages
 - public bad:  vertical aggregation:  一个污染对小王，和对小李的damage加在一起。

### Marginal Abatement cost

 - minimum cos tof reducing emissions
 - different technology or location
 - horizontal aggregation: 老王和老李的污染，成本从低的开始。

### Equally marginal priciple

#### total damage
#### savings 
#### total abate cost


##### Consider a single emitter of a pollutant. Assume that the government knows the MAC curve but not the MD curve.


an optimal emissions tax, the optimal number of transferable emission permits and an optimal performance standard would all yield the same level of social welfare.


??? Only under uncertainty,  whether an emission tax or transferable emission permits results in social welfare loss depends on the steepness of the MAC curve.

##### Creating the incentive for firms to innovate to reduce their MAC curves

depends on the choice of government policy.

##### If transferable emission permits are auctioned off

The outcome is the same as a uniform performance standard.

The outcome is the same as the government taxing emissions.

???The outcome is the same as if the property right was granted to the recipient and there was a negotiated outcome


##### Consider two (static) optimal policies: the socially optimal emission tax and the socially optimal number of transferable emission permits. 

The incentive to invest in R&D to lower marginal abatement costs when the firm anticipates

1) receiving the same number of transferable emission permits regardless of the investment and 2) the same price of the permits

is exactly the same incentive the firm would face if facing a constant tax at the original optimal rate.


##### Firms prefer emission taxes because

efficient.

##### Assigning property rights and relying on bargaining between affected parties can solve externality problems when

there are few counter-parties and transaction costs are small.
